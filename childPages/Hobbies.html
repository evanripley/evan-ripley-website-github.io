        My name is Evan, I grew up in Edmonton AB, I have many plans for the future. I attend Jasper Place Highschool and enjoy playig videogames on my spare time.
        My favourite subject is Biology and Art, I hope to become a Graphic Designer or some kind of biologist in the near future.

      As for my hobbies, I mentioned that I enjoyed gaming. But I also really enjoy building a intricate vehicle model.
      The process is long, tedious but theraputic. spending 6 hours working on something that probably wont matter, or be thrown out soon
      is really reflective for me. Thats why I enjoy it so much. Also, I really like going out playing ice-hockey with my close friends.
      We might not be the best, but its the highlight of my week(s). A more actually important hobby I endure is Cooking! I love cooking, weather
      its simple scrambled eggs, or a complex three course dinner. I cook at least once a week for my family , and its always just a good time.
