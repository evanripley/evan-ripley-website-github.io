      My history is fairly basic, other than my grandmother, whom was adopted. My whole life, Ive been told I was Dutch and German. Which I am, but
      Ive always felt like that wasnt just it. fairly recently, about 4 years ago, I learned that my grandmother was adopted, which obviously,
      changes my heritage. She was from Scandinavia, more nothern near Norway. Now knowing that I am Dutch, German and Norwegian just motivates
      me to travel to those places. Europe would be incredible. Massive buildings, culture, but more importantly, food. My childhood or life in
      general hasnt really been affected by my heritage, other than opening christmas gifts on christmas eve as a German tradition.
